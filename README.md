# End to End Selenium Test Automation Framework (Testng - Java).

This is basic level test automation framework created using Selenium - testng, this should give great start for beginner to selenium world.

Most of us learn all selenium concepts, but when it comes to framework development, we lag there. This framework should help you on this.

Framework include below capabilities.
1. Selenium - testng - Java
2. POM (Page Factory)
3. Standalone scenario automation
4. Data driven scenarios - Using dataprovider and Hashmap // without dataprovider
5. Extent report included.

 . . .Selenium Grid, Jenkins, Docker support will be included in advanced level framework, (in progress). Do subscribe to my channel to keep yourself updated.
